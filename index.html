<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>
    I am a researcher at <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>, part of <a href="https://www.tu9-universities.de/">TU9</a> (the alliance of leading Technical Universities in Germany), and PhD candidate, advised by <a href="https://software-lab.org/people/Michael_Pradel.html">Prof. Dr. Michael Pradel</a>.
</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>
    My main research focus is at the intersection of software engineering and quantum computing, with the aim of increasing the reliability of the quantum software stack.
    In addition to my focus on quantum computing, I also love to explore the application of Explainable AI for models of code.
    I am excited by any challenging research ideas at the intersection of these topics:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Explainable AI, Data Science and Machine Learning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Computing</strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Contact Me</h2>
