<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>
    I am a researcher at <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>, part of <a href="https://www.tu9-universities.de/">TU9</a> (the alliance of leading Technical Universities in Germany), and PhD candidate, advised by <a href="https://software-lab.org/people/Michael_Pradel.html">Prof. Dr. Michael Pradel</a>.
</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>
    My research focuses on Explainable AI techniques to increase programmer's usage of machine learning solutions.
    I am excited by any challenging research ideas at the intersection of these topics:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Science</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Explainable AI</strong></li>
    </ul>
    I am also getting more and more interested in <strong>Quantum Computing</strong>.
