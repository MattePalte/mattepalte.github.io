I"<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>

<p>
    I am a researcher at <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>, part of <a href="https://www.tu9-universities.de/">TU9</a> (the alliance of leading Technical Universities in Germany), and PhD candidate, advised by <a href="https://software-lab.org/people/Michael_Pradel.html">Prof. Dr. Michael Pradel</a>.
    My driving interest consists of applications of Data Science and Software Engineering to solve challenging problems. My research focuses on Explainable AI techniques to increase programmer's usage of machine learning solutions.
</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>Previously, I researched on anomaly detection methods at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> <a href="https://information-technology.web.cern.ch/about/organisation/compute-monitoring">Cloud Team</a>, where I laid the foundation of their first anomaly detection system togheter with <a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/703218/overview">PhD. Domenico Giordano</a>. I completed my  Double M.Sc. in Computer Science Engineering (specialization in Data Science) at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/">Politecnico di Milano</a> and <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/">Technical University of Berlin</a> as a part of <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/">EIT Digital Master School</a>.
    I am naturally curious and I love to face challenging situations that make me grow.
</p>

<h2>Five years from now</h2>
<p>
    My long-term objective is to convert innovative research results into products to assist software engineers in their work.
    In fact, in my spare time I love to reason on business plan ideas, stay informed about start-ups and participate in hackathons.
</p>

<h2>Passions for gender topics</h2>
<p> I am also a big fan of gender equality topics and for this reason I volunteer as Local Leader Manager at <a href="https://womeneit.eu/about-us/">Women@EIT</a>.
